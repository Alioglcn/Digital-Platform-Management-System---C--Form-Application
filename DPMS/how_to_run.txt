There is a panel on the first form. This called iss "Admin Panel". Admin should login with username and password.

username = adminpanel
password = 654321

After login, there will be open other form. There are 7 buttons representing the tables in the database. You should click on that button on which table you want to process.

For example, if you enter audience button, there will open "customers operations" form. There are textboxes and a datagridview in order to see all datas on the database. 

If you want to add any data, fill the textboxes and click on the (+) button.
If you want to delete any data, just select it from the row from the datagridview and click on the (delete) button.
If you want to update any data, just select it and datas will fills the textboxes automatically and change them from textboxes and click on the (update) button.

Clear button for clean all the textboxes.

The process is same for all tables. If you want to log out from the system, just click the exit and the system ask you like are you sure ? You should say "Yes".

Note : Please be carefull duplicate primary keys when you add a new data. I suggest you to choose id > 1000 when you add new data in all tables.
